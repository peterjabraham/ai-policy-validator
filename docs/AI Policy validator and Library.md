# AI Policy validator and Library

AI policies for companies typically bundle three things: governance (who decides), usage rules (what’s allowed), and risk controls (how you stay safe and compliant).~[lattice+2](https://lattice.com/templates/ai-usage-policy-template)~

# 1\. Core building blocks (what every AI policy needs)
From current templates and guidance, modern AI policies for companies converge on a common core:~[aihr+3](https://www.aihr.com/blog/ai-policy-template/)~
* **Purpose & scope**
  * Why the policy exists (e.g. safe, ethical, compliant AI that drives business outcomes).
  * Who it applies to: all employees, contractors, vendors using AI on the company’s behalf.~[hibob+1](https://www.hibob.com/guides/ai-policy-template/)~
  * What it covers: generative AI, ML models, analytics, internal and third‑party tools, and relevant jurisdictions (UK, EU, US, etc.).~[witness+1](https://witness.ai/blog/ai-policy-template/)~
* Governance & roles
  * AI steering committee / cross‑functional group (IT, data, legal, HR, security, product) owning policy and decisions.~[ai21+2](https://www.ai21.com/knowledge/ai-governance-frameworks/)~
  * Named owners: AI lead, data protection, security, compliance, business sponsors; clear escalation paths for “high‑risk” use cases.~[technologyquotient.freshfields+1](https://technologyquotient.freshfields.com/post/102j3x7/building-your-companys-ai-governance-framework)~
* Principles (ethics + risk appetite)
  * Fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, security, human oversight as explicit guiding principles.~[diligent+3](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/ai-governance)~
  * Alignment with risk appetite: which types of AI use are encouraged, restricted, or not acceptable at all.~[fairnow+2](https://fairnow.ai/ai-acceptable-use-policy-template/)~
* Usage rules (acceptable / prohibited / controlled)
  * Categories of AI use: permitted, prohibited, controlled (requires review/approval).~[tenable+2](https://www.tenable.com/blog/security-for-ai-a-practical-guide-to-enforcing-your-ai-acceptable-use-policy)~
  * Typical prohibitions: feeding confidential or personal data into public tools, fully automated high‑impact decisions without human review, surveillance or biometric profiling, disinformation, discrimination.~[littler+3](https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/considerations-artificial-intelligence-policies-workplace)~
  * Typical permitted: summarisation, drafting, ideation, code suggestions, internal search – with human review and proper labels.~[lattice+3](https://lattice.com/templates/ai-usage-policy-template)~
* Data & privacy safeguards
  * Explicit rules on what data can/cannot go into AI systems, how PII and sensitive data are handled, and data residency if relevant.~[witness+3](https://witness.ai/blog/ai-policy-template/)~
  * Requirements for vendors: DPAs, security controls, auditability, no training on customer data without agreement.~[responsible+2](http://www.responsible.ai/ai-policy-template/)~
* Development & procurement standards
  * For in‑house models: requirements for data quality, documentation, testing, monitoring, and model lifecycle management.~[dualitytech+2](https://dualitytech.com/blog/ai-governance-framework/)~
  * For third‑party tools: evaluation checklist (purpose, data flows, risks, legal/reg alignment: EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, etc.).~[ai21+2](https://www.ai21.com/knowledge/ai-governance-frameworks/)~
* Monitoring, audit, and incident handling
  * Logging and audit trails for material AI decisions; periodic reviews of high‑risk systems.~[diligent+2](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/ai-governance)~
  * Defined incident response for AI‑related issues (e.g. data leakage, harmful outputs, bias incidents).~[tenable+2](https://www.tenable.com/blog/security-for-ai-a-practical-guide-to-enforcing-your-ai-acceptable-use-policy)~
* Training, awareness, and change management
  * Mandatory training on how to use AI tools, check for errors/bias, respect privacy/IP, and follow the policy.~[lattice+2](https://lattice.com/templates/ai-usage-policy-template)~
  * Ongoing communication as tools and regulations evolve (EU AI Act timelines, regulator guidance, etc.).~[ai21+1](https://www.ai21.com/knowledge/ai-governance-frameworks/)~
* Enforcement, reporting, and whistleblowing
  * How violations are handled, and links to general disciplinary policies.~[hibob+2](https://www.hibob.com/guides/ai-policy-template/)~
  * Protected reporting channels for employees to flag problematic AI use or outputs.~[fairnow+2](https://fairnow.ai/ai-acceptable-use-policy-template/)~


You can see full AI policies and templates publicly; several orgs host downloadable docs and checklists.~[mescomputing+7](https://www.mescomputing.com/news/4214515/ai-policy-templates-framework)~
# 1\. Ready‑to‑use policy templates
These are good starting points you can adapt:
* Lattice – AI Usage Policy Template (HR/people‑centric, employee‑facing, very usable as a first draft HR/IT policy).[~[lattice](https://lattice.com/templates/ai-usage-policy-template)~] 
* Workable – AI Tool Usage Policy Template (recruiting and more general AI‑tool usage, practical “dos and don’ts”).[~[resources.workable](https://resources.workable.com/ai-tool-usage-policy)~] 
* ISACA – Artificial Intelligence Acceptable Use Policy Template (more governance/risk‑oriented, security/audit flavour).[~[isaca](https://www.isaca.org/resources/artificial-intelligence-acceptable-use-policy-template)~] 
* Responsible AI Institute – AI Policy Template (broader governance, alignment with ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF, good for enterprise framing).[~[responsible](https://www.responsible.ai/ai-policy-template/)~]

* EAB and similar higher‑ed resources – guides on crafting generative AI acceptable use policies for institutions.[~[eab](https://eab.com/resources/blog/strategy-blog/craft-ai-acceptable-use-policy-protect-campus/)~] 

⠀
# Quick illustration
For example, you could:
1. Take the Fisher Phillips sample for the “acceptable use” section wording.[~[fisherphillips](https://www.fisherphillips.com/a/web/du6wach1kmRuPCgDcMLJ5Z/ai-policy.pdf)~] 
2. Layer in governance and risk language from Responsible AI Institute and ISACA.~[isaca+1](https://www.isaca.org/resources/artificial-intelligence-acceptable-use-policy-template)~
3. Borrow the monitoring/review structure from ECCH or the ICO internal AI policy.~[ecch+1](https://www.ecch.org/media/y0kb3u5w/artificial-intelligence-ai-governance-policy-v2.pdf)~


# There is no single global “AI policy body”, but there are emerging authorities and coordinating bodies in each region that shape organisational AI policy expectations.~[wikipedia+4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Artificial_Intelligence_Office)~
# 1\. United Kingdom
The UK is deliberately **decentralised**: sector regulators lead, coordinated by central AI policy units.~[iapp+1](https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-governance-uk)~
* Office for Artificial Intelligence / AI Policy Directorate in DSIT – central team responsible for overarching AI policy and implementation of the UK’s National AI Strategy.~[gov+3](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-artificial-intelligence)~
* Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) – advises government on data and AI ethics, transparency, and safe use; influential for organisational governance norms.~[publishing.service+1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/614db4d1e90e077a2cbdf3c4/National_AI_Strategy_-_PDF_version.pdf)~
* AI Security Institute (AISI) – evaluates safety and security of advanced AI models; shapes expectations for testing and risk assessment.~[anecdotes+1](https://www.anecdotes.ai/learn/ai-regulations-in-2025-us-eu-uk-japan-china-and-more)~
* Cross‑sector regulators – ICO (data protection), FCA, CMA, MHRA, etc., are expected to set AI‑specific guidance within their remit rather than a new super‑regulator.~[iapp+1](https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-governance-uk)~

⠀For an organisation in the UK, this means you look to ICO + your sector regulator for binding rules, with DSIT/CDEI material as the reference point for “good” AI governance practice.~[mojdigital.blog+2](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2025/12/17/introducing-the-ministry-of-justice-engineering-ai-governance-framework/)~
# 2\. European Union
The EU is moving toward a more **centralised** AI regulatory regime through the AI Act.~[digital-strategy.europa+3](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-act-governance-and-enforcement)~
* European AI Office – new EU‑level regulator within the Commission (DG CNECT), with exclusive powers for general‑purpose AI models and coordination of AI Act enforcement.~[clydeco+3](https://www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2025/05/preparing-for-enforcement-a-guide-to-the-eu-ai-act)~
* European Artificial Intelligence Board – representatives of member states; steers consistent application of the AI Act.~[digital-strategy.europa+1](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-act-governance-and-enforcement)~
* National competent authorities & market surveillance authorities – designated in each member state; supervise and enforce AI rules for systems and providers in their territory.~[clydeco+1](https://www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2025/05/preparing-for-enforcement-a-guide-to-the-eu-ai-act)~

⠀For organisational AI policy in the EU, the AI Act plus guidance from the AI Office and your national authority becomes the de‑facto “body” you design policies around (risk classification, documentation, conformity assessment, etc.).~[orrick+2](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/09/The-EU-AI-Act-Oversight-and-Enforcement)~
# 3\. United States
The US currently has a **fragmented, pro‑innovation** federal stance with no single AI regulator; responsibilities are split among existing agencies.~[mindfoundry+2](https://www.mindfoundry.ai/blog/ai-regulations-around-the-world)~
* Federal executive direction – Executive Order 14179 (“Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence”) reoriented AI policy toward deregulation, revoking much of the previous federal AI oversight framework.~[ai+2](https://www.ai.gov/)~
* Coordination roles – the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, a Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the National Security Advisor lead a cross‑government AI Action Plan rather than a standalone regulator.~[anecdotes+2](https://www.anecdotes.ai/learn/ai-regulations-in-2025-us-eu-uk-japan-china-and-more)~
* Sectoral regulators – FTC, CFPB, EEOC, FDA, SEC, etc., apply existing laws (consumer protection, discrimination, financial regulation, medical devices) to AI rather than through a unified AI authority.~[mindfoundry+1](https://www.mindfoundry.ai/blog/ai-regulations-around-the-world)~

⠀So in the US, organisational AI policies tend to align with general federal guidance and NIST frameworks, plus whatever your primary regulator expects, rather than a dedicated “AI policy body”.~[anecdotes+1](https://www.anecdotes.ai/learn/ai-regulations-in-2025-us-eu-uk-japan-china-and-more)~
# 4\. How this translates for organisational AI policy
In practice, “organisational AI policy” is shaped by these bodies but owned by the company:
* UK: follow principles from DSIT/CDEI and map them to ICO + sector‑regulator expectations.
* EU: treat the AI Act and the European AI Office as your canonical source of obligations, with local national authority guidance layered in.
* US: align with general federal direction and NIST‑style governance, then tailor to sectoral regulator risk expectations.

# How could you do this efficiently, for individual companies but as a web-based solution that does it for you: UK: follow principles from DSIT/CDEI and map them to ICO + sector‑regulator expectations.

You could turn that mapping into a semi-automated “AI policy configurator” that reads UK guidance once, codifies it, and then tailors outputs per company via a web app.~[gov+5](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques)~
I’ll keep this tight and practical.

# 1\. Core product idea
A web app that:
1. Asks a company a structured set of questions (sector, size, processing of personal data, high‑risk use cases, etc.).
2. Maps answers to UK AI principles (DSIT/CDEI), data protection requirements (ICO), and sector‑regulator signals.
3. Generates a tailored AI policy pack: governance model, acceptable‑use policy, DPIA prompts, assurance checklist, and regulator‑specific “to‑watch” notes.~[gov+6](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-roadmap-to-an-effective-ai-assurance-ecosystem)~

⠀Think: “Stripe Radar for compliance content”, but opinionated for AI and the UK.

# 2\. Normalising the guidance once (your knowledge layer)
You pre‑digest the messy guidance into a machine‑readable model:
* DSIT/CDEI principles → tagged requirements
  * E.g. “safety, security, robustness”, “transparency and explainability”, “fairness”, “accountability and governance”, “contestability and redress” as defined in UK AI guidance to regulators.~[osborneclarke+2](https://www.osborneclarke.com/insights/uk-government-publishes-guidance-responsible-artificial-intelligence-human-resources-and)~
  * CDEI portfolio of AI assurance techniques gives you a catalogue of assurance methods (impact assessment, bias audit, red‑teaming, evaluation).~[loti+5](https://loti.london/blog/dsit-ai-assurance/)~
* ICO AI & data protection → DP‑specific constraints
  * UK GDPR principles as applied to AI (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimisation, DPIA triggers, data protection by design/default).~[rpclegal+2](https://www.rpclegal.com/snapshots/data-protection/summer-2023/ico-updates-its-guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/)~
  * ICO’s AI risk toolkit patterns as reusable checks.~[insideprivacy+1](https://www.insideprivacy.com/artificial-intelligence/uk-ico-updates-guidance-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/)~
* Sector‑regulator overlays
  * “Profiles” for HR/recruitment (DSIT HR AI guidance, ICO fairness focus), financial services (FCA expectations), health, local gov, etc.~[rpclegal+2](https://www.rpclegal.com/snapshots/data-protection/summer-2023/ico-updates-its-guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/)~

⠀Internally this becomes a rule graph or knowledge base: for each “company + use case” pattern you pre‑define which obligations and assurance techniques fire.

# 3\. The configurator flow (per company)
# Step 1 – Intake questionnaire
In the web UI, collect:
* Basic profile:
  * Sector(s), size, jurisdictions (UK‑only vs UK+EU/US), data categories (special category, children, criminal, etc.).
* AI use profile:
  * Internal GenAI use (productivity), decisioning systems (credit, hiring, claims), safety‑critical use, customer‑facing chatbots, etc.
* Technology choices:
  * Public SaaS LLMs vs private instances, in‑house models, third‑party HR/finance tools with embedded AI.

⠀This is a 10–15 minute flow, built as a wizard.
# Step 2 – Rules engine + templates
Behind the scenes you run rules like:
* If sector = “HR/Recruitment” → attach DSIT HR AI guidance patterns + ICO fairness/impact DPIA expectations.~[osborneclarke+1](https://www.osborneclarke.com/insights/uk-government-publishes-guidance-responsible-artificial-intelligence-human-resources-and)~
* If “high‑risk automated decision about individuals using personal data” → require DPIA, human‑in‑the‑loop, explanation duty, records of alternatives considered.~[hunton+2](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/uk-ico-issues-updated-guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection)~
* If “local gov / public sector” → suggest use of CDEI AI assurance portfolio techniques and local‑gov specific assurance practices.~[burges-salmon+5](https://www.burges-salmon.com/articles/102igja/ai-assurance-portfolio-of-techniques-published-by-cdei/)~

⠀Those rules select from a library of policy clauses and process diagrams.
# Step 3 – Output artefacts
Generate:
* AI governance charter: roles, AI committee, RACI, escalation rules – aligned to UK regulatory principles language.~[gov+1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-roadmap-to-an-effective-ai-assurance-ecosystem)~
* Internal AI use policy: acceptable use, prohibited uses, data handling, logging, training – aligned to ICO’s AI/data‑protection guidance.~[insideprivacy+1](https://www.insideprivacy.com/artificial-intelligence/uk-ico-updates-guidance-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/)~
* DPIA & assurance prompts: questions and techniques drawn from ICO DPIA guidance and CDEI assurance portfolio (impact assessments, bias audits, model cards, etc.).~[aistandardshub+5](https://aistandardshub.org/guidance/cdei-portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques/)~
* Regulator lens page: a short, human‑readable note: “For you, the ICO cares most about X; DSIT/CDEI emphasise Y; your sector regulator is likely to look at Z.”~[loti+4](https://loti.london/blog/dsit-ai-assurance/)~

⠀All produced as editable markdown/Word plus a dashboard view.

# 4\. Making it efficient and scalable
To keep this efficient for both you and users:
* Policy primitives not full drafts
  * Maintain granular building blocks (definitions, clauses, checklists, flow steps) that can be recombined, instead of monolithic templates.
  * This makes it easier to update when UK guidance changes.
* Opinionated defaults with “risk tiers”
  * Offer “baseline”, “enhanced”, and “high‑risk” profiles so smaller orgs can accept sensible defaults without endless choices.
  * High‑risk paths automatically inject stronger assurance techniques and documentation burdens.~[gov+3](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques)~
* Explainability and traceability
  * For each generated section, show “why this is here” with short just‑in‑time explanations mapped to ICO/DSIT/CDEI references (not legal advice, but transparent link‑back).~[burges-salmon+5](https://www.burges-salmon.com/articles/102igja/ai-assurance-portfolio-of-techniques-published-by-cdei/)~
* Human in the loop
  * You position this as “policy engineering assistant”: it gets you to 70–80%, then external counsel or internal risk/compliance review and sign‑off.

⠀
# 5\. Example: small UK SaaS (B2B) using GenAI for support
For a 50‑person UK SaaS that:
* Uses OpenAI/Anthropic via API for support summarisation,
* Has a basic HR screening tool with AI ranking CVs,

⠀Your app might:
* Flag: ICO DPIA needed for recruitment AI; prompt HR‑specific fairness + transparency steps from DSIT HR guidance.~[rpclegal+2](https://www.rpclegal.com/snapshots/data-protection/summer-2023/ico-updates-its-guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/)~
* Generate: AI acceptable‑use policy restricting customer personal data in public LLMs and requiring logging/monitoring.~[hunton+2](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/uk-ico-issues-updated-guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection)~
* Suggest: simple assurance techniques – pre‑deployment testing, periodic bias checks on the CV‑ranking model, and an impact assessment template.~[aistandardshub+4](https://aistandardshub.org/guidance/cdei-portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques/)~

# ⠀ How can we tie this back to 'with evidence-backed claims' e.g. would we use a form of citations or something else?

You’d want “evidence‑backed” to mean: every policy clause and control can be traced to an underlying regulatory or guidance source, and you can show that trace quickly to a regulator or board.~[servicenow+4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-governance-risk-compliance/page/product/grc-policy-and-compliance/concept/citation-to-control-mapping.html)~
# 1\. Use a citations layer, like a mini-regtech graph
At the core, you maintain a mapping between three things:~[ibm+4](https://www.ibm.com/new/product-blog/ibm-watsonx-platform-compliance-obligations-to-controls-mapping)~
* Regulatory sources
  * ICO AI & data protection guidance, UK GDPR text, DSIT AI regulatory principles, CDEI assurance guidance, sector‑regulator docs.~[gov+4](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-uks-ai-regulatory-principles-initial-guidance-for-regulators/implementing-the-uks-ai-regulatory-principles-initial-guidance-for-regulators)~
* Internal “obligations”
  * Normalised statements such as “perform DPIA for high‑risk AI decisions”, “ensure explainability for decisions with legal effects”, “implement bias monitoring”.~[ico+3](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/)~
* Policy clauses & controls
  * Concrete text in your generated policy, plus linked processes (e.g. DPIA template, bias testing procedure, logging control).~[empoweredsystems+5](https://empoweredsystems.com/blog/turning-policy-into-practice-linking-controls-and-training-for-real-compliance/)~

⠀In the UI, each clause/control gets a hover or link that shows its “evidence”: citations to ICO paragraphs, DSIT principle sections, or CDEI portfolio items.~[grantthornton+4](https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/insights/regtech-automating-regulatory-change-compliance/)~

# 2\. How the evidence model works (under the hood)
You can borrow patterns from GRC platforms that map policies ↔ controls ↔ citations:~[ardoq+5](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/349654-regulatory-compliance-purpose-scope-and-rationale)~
* Create a “citation object” model
  * Each citation stores: source (ICO, DSIT, CDEI, regulator), document, section/paragraph, quote/summary, and URL.~[ico+3](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/legal-framework/)~
  * Example: “ICO, AI & Data Protection guidance, ‘How do we ensure lawfulness in AI?’, para X – requires identification of legal basis and DPIA for high‑risk AI.”~[ico+2](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/how-do-we-ensure-lawfulness-in-ai/)~
* Link citations to obligations
  * For each obligation, link one or more citations that justify it.
  * E.g. obligation “Conduct DPIA for AI doing large‑scale profiling” → cites ICO AI legal framework and DPIA guidance sections.~[ico+2](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/)~
* Link obligations to policy text & controls
  * Your generated clause “We will conduct a DPIA before deploying any AI system making high‑impact automated decisions” inherits the citation links from the obligation.
  * A specific control “DPIA workflow in n8n + Notion” is also tied to that same obligation and its citations.~[servicenow+4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-governance-risk-compliance/page/product/grc-policy-and-compliance/concept/citation-to-control-mapping.html)~

⠀That creates a traceable chain: regulator/guidance → obligation → policy text/control.~[ibm+5](https://www.ibm.com/new/product-blog/ibm-watsonx-platform-compliance-obligations-to-controls-mapping)~

# 3\. How to surface this in a web-based configurator
On the front end, you can implement “evidence‑backed” in a few user‑visible ways:~[grantthornton+5](https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/insights/regtech-automating-regulatory-change-compliance/)~
* Inline references in generated documents
  * At the end of a clause, show compact tags like “[ICO – AI guidance, Lawfulness]” which link back to a side panel with full reference and text snippet.~[ico+2](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/legal-framework/)~
  * For internal use, you might show IDs (e.g. OBL‑AI‑DPIA‑001) that map into your obligation registry.~[ardoq+2](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/349654-regulatory-compliance-purpose-scope-and-rationale)~
* Evidence panel per section
  * When a user clicks a clause like “Transparency and Explainability”, open a right‑hand panel listing:
    * Which ICO / DSIT / CDEI sections support this.
    * Whether this is “must”, “should”, or “best practice” based on how strong the source is (law vs guidance).~[gov+3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-uks-ai-regulatory-principles-initial-guidance-for-regulators/implementing-the-uks-ai-regulatory-principles-initial-guidance-for-regulators)~
* Regulator view / export
  * One click export: a table showing your internal obligations, mapped policy clauses and controls, and their regulatory citations – essentially a “compliance matrix”.~[auditboard+4](https://auditboard.com/blog/leveraging-unified-compliance-framework)~

⠀This mirrors how GRC tools associate citations to controls and recompute compliance evidence.~[servicenow+3](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-governance-risk-compliance/page/product/grc-policy-and-compliance/concept/citation-to-control-mapping.html)~

# 4\. Ensuring the claims stay “evidence-backed”
To keep it robust as guidance evolves:~[finreg-e+6](https://finreg-e.com/machine-readable-regulation/)~
* Maintain a curated rulebook
  * Ingest and normalise ICO and DSIT updates into a machine‑readable “rulebook”, similar to machine‑readable regulation projects and UCF‑style frameworks.~[auditboard+4](https://auditboard.com/blog/leveraging-unified-compliance-framework)~
  * Track versions so you can show “this clause was generated against ICO guidance vX on date Y”.~[ibm+2](https://www.ibm.com/new/product-blog/ibm-watsonx-platform-compliance-obligations-to-controls-mapping)~
* Horizon scanning
  * Use automated monitoring (RSS, APIs, scraping) for ICO, DSIT, CDEI, and sector‑regulator updates; flag when a citation’s source changes or is superseded.~[jerseyfsc+3](https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/3snb4zbe/regulatory-technology-implementation-guide.pdf)~
  * Trigger impact analysis: list which obligations and clauses are affected so you can update mappings semi‑automatically.~[jerseyfsc+1](https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/3snb4zbe/regulatory-technology-implementation-guide.pdf)~
* Quality checks / human review
  * Periodically sample obligations and their citations to confirm the mapping is still correct and the interpretation is conservative enough.~[blogs.law.ox+4](https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2019/10/regulatory-technology-introducing-evidence-based-and-data-driven)~

⠀That’s how you can honestly tell clients “each recommendation is tied to named paragraphs in ICO/DSIT/CDEI materials, and here’s the chain”.~[ico+6](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/how-do-we-ensure-lawfulness-in-ai/)~


# Show a concrete example for one use case (e.g. recruitment AI DPIA path) with the full evidence chain.
Here’s a concrete, end‑to‑end example for **AI in recruitment** showing the full chain: source → obligation → policy text → controls, all evidence‑backed.

# 1\. Scenario and high‑level obligation
**Scenario** UK employer wants to use an AI tool to score and rank job applicants, using CVs and application data (personal data, potentially special category data). This is likely **high‑risk processing** (profiling with significant effects), so a DPIA and stronger safeguards are expected.~[ico+5](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/11/ico-intervention-into-ai-recruitment-tools-leads-to-better-data-protection-for-job-seekers/)~

# 2\. Generated policy clause (what the company sees)
Your web app takes that obligation and generates a policy section, automatically attaching the evidence.
**Policy text (example)**
**Data Protection Impact Assessments for Recruitment AI**
Before procuring or deploying any AI system that profiles, scores, or ranks job applicants, we will complete a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** to identify and mitigate privacy and fairness risks. The DPIA will be completed at the earliest possible stage (typically during procurement), updated when the system, data, or use changes, and retained as part of our accountability records. Where the DPIA identifies high risks that cannot be mitigated, we will not deploy the system until we have consulted the ICO or an alternative solution is found.


**Evidence attached in the UI**
When the user hovers over a small “Evidence” badge on this clause, a side panel shows:
* ICO – AI tools in recruitment audits and recommendations (2024–25): emphasis on completing DPIAs before integrating AI tools in recruitment and keeping them updated.~[farrer+5](https://www.farrer.co.uk/news-and-insights/using-ai-in-recruitment-new-guidance-from-the-ico-on-key-compliance-obligations/)~
* ICO – AI and data protection guidance: DPIAs required for high‑risk AI processing (innovative tech, large‑scale profiling, etc.).~[ico+4](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/what-goes-into-an-explanation/)~
* DSIT/RTU – Responsible AI in Recruitment guidance: explicit requirement to complete a DPIA and consult ICO if high risks remain.~[gov+1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsible-ai-in-recruitment-guide/responsible-ai-in-recruitment)~

⠀In your database, that policy clause is linked to OBL‑DPIA‑RECRUIT‑001, which in turn has those three citation records.

# 3\. Concrete operational controls with evidence
Now you tie the same obligation to **controls** in the operating model.
**Control 1 – Mandatory DPIA trigger in the intake process**
* Control description: “Any new AI recruitment tool must go through the AI Use Intake Form. If the form indicates scoring/ranking of applicants using personal data, the workflow automatically creates a DPIA record and routes it to the DPO for review before contracts are signed.”
* Evidence link:
  * OBL‑DPIA‑RECRUIT‑001 (DPIA for recruitment AI).~[ico+5](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/11/ico-intervention-into-ai-recruitment-tools-leads-to-better-data-protection-for-job-seekers/)~
  * ICO guidance on doing DPIAs early in the project lifecycle (not post‑deployment).~[ico+3](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/)~

⠀**Control 2 – DPIA template content**
* Implementation: Your DPIA template (Notion/Confluence/whatever) has specific sections tailored to recruitment AI:
  * “Describe the AI model and what decisions it influences in the recruitment lifecycle.”
  * “List all categories of personal data used, including any inferred characteristics.”
  * “Assess risks of unfair discrimination or exclusion of protected groups and describe mitigation (e.g. testing for bias, human review).”
  * “Explain how candidates are informed about the use of AI and their rights to challenge decisions.”
* Evidence:
  * ICO recruitment audits and recommendations: concerns about unfair exclusion, inference of protected characteristics, over‑collection/retention of personal data.~[dataprotectionpeople+5](https://dataprotectionpeople.com/resource-centre/icos-ai-recruitment-audit/)~
  * ICO/Turing guidance on explaining AI decisions in ways affected individuals can understand.~[ico+3](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/)~
  * DSIT Responsible AI in Recruitment: encourages using assurance mechanisms like DPIAs to address fairness, transparency, and accountability.~[rtau.blog+1](https://rtau.blog.gov.uk/2024/03/25/how-ai-assurance-can-support-trustworthy-ai-in-recruitment/)~

⠀**Control 3 – Vendor due diligence checklist**
* Implementation: Before signing with an AI recruitment vendor, the procurement checklist requires:
  * Clarifying controller/processor roles and including this in the contract.
  * Asking for vendor’s own DPIA or privacy risk assessment.
  * Requesting bias testing results and accuracy metrics.
  * Confirming data minimisation and retention limits.
* Evidence:
  * ICO “Thinking of using AI to assist recruitment? Our key data protection questions” – mandates asking key questions about roles, instructions, compliance, bias, and performance.[~[ico.org](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/11/thinking-of-using-ai-to-assist-recruitment-our-key-data-protection-considerations/)~] 
  * ICO AI recruitment audits and subsequent recommendations to developers and recruiters.~[ico+4](https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/audits-and-overview-reports/2024/11/ai-tools-in-recruitment/)~
  * DSIT guidance on using AI assurance mechanisms in procurement of recruitment AI.~[gov+1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsible-ai-in-recruitment-guide/responsible-ai-in-recruitment)~

⠀Each checklist item in your tool can show a short note: “Backed by: ICO recruitment AI recommendations, DSIT Responsible AI in Recruitment guidance.”

# 4\. What a “compliance matrix” export would look like
Your app could export something like this (conceptually):
| **Internal ID** | **Obligation summary** | **Policy section / control** | **Evidence (regulator & guidance)** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

That table is what you would show to:
* A regulator if questioned (“Here is the clause, here’s the specific ICO/DSIT paragraph it implements”).
* A board or PE diligence team (“Here is how our controls trace to UK guidance on AI in recruitment”).
